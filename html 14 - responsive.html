    What is Responsive Web Design?
    Responsive Web Design is about using HTML and CSS to automatically resize, hide, shrink, or enlarge, 
    a website, to make it look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones):

    <!-- Setting The Viewport
    To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to all your web pages:
    --> 
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML RESPONSIVE</title>

    <style>
        * {
            box-sizing: border-box;
        }
    </style>

    Responsive Images
    Responsive images are images that scale nicely to fit any browser size.

    Using the width Property
    If the CSS width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:  
    
    Using the max-width Property
    If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be 
    larger than its original size:
    -->
    <img src="cricket.jpg" style="width: 100%;">
    <img src="Brush Tool.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;">

    <!--
    Responsive Text Size
    The text size can be set with a "vw" unit, which means the "viewport width".
    That way the text size will follow the size of the browser window:
    Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.
