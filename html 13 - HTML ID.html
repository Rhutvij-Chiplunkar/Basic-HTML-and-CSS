The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within 
the HTML document.The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also
used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.The syntax for id is: write a hash 
haracter (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.In the following 
example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". This <h1> element will be styled 
according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:

<body>
    <!--
    Difference Between Class and ID
    A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements,
    while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:
    -->
    <div id="ID">
        <h1> This is ID tag</h1>
        <p>Id tag is very useful </p>
    </div>

    <!--
    HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
    HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.
    Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.
    To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.
    Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.
